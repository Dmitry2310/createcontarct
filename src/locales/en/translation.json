Unlike paper contracts, the work during the conclusion of the contract (printing, sealing, mailing) can be simplified, and what used to take several days can be completed in a few minutes.",

  "home_first_block_3_text": " is a blockchain mechanism that automates the management of contract execution, for example, [when certain conditions are met, predefined processing is automatically performed] for a certain contract or transaction. Even in cases where it is difficult to carry out procedures in cooperation between related companies, it is possible to automate the transaction process by automatically performing transactions on the network in accordance with the established rules.",

  "home_fourth_block_title": "Blockchain is",
  "home_fourth_block_first_line_text": "The biggest feature of the blockchain is a mechanism that can increase reliability and prevent forgery by recording data with each other even without the participation of an administrator. Unlike the usual method focused on a single server, data is not concentrated in one place because it creates a network-like system. Thus, it has the advantage that it is difficult to disconnect it from the system.",
  "home_fourth_block_second_line_text": "The traditional idea of data security is to store data on a single server and create a reliable security system that protects this data. On the other hand, blockchain increases security by managing the same data on multiple computers. Even if you rewrite some data, it is difficult to rewrite everything, because the data is linked like a chain, and data management is carried out in several places. In addition, the transaction data stored in the block is encrypted using a hash function. Thus, highly secure data management can be implemented.",
  "home_fourth_block_third_line_text": "While data encryption increases security, transparency and integrity of transactions can be compromised. In this regard, the blockchain stores the same information in several blocks. As a result, we managed to increase security and at the same time maintain transparency of information.",

In addition, it has the peculiarity that neither a person nor a third party can change data, and it has excellent transparency, as well as many advantages, such as the ability to speed up contracts and transactions by automating and eliminating human errors.",
